Version: 0.2-1
Author: Dai Feng [aut, cre], Damjan Manevski [auc], Maja Pohar Perme [auc]
Description: Estimate the AUC using a variety of methods as follows: 
             (1) frequentist nonparametric methods based on the Mann-Whitney statistic or kernel methods. 
             (2) frequentist parametric methods using the likelihood ratio test based on higher-order 
             asymptotic results, the signed log-likelihood ratio test, the Wald test, 
             or the approximate ''t'' solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem. 
             (3) Bayesian parametric MCMC methods.
